Our page for statistics about the Covid-19 pandemic is quite rich for the approx. 200 countries that we cover. Let&#39;s review those data items in detail.

For each item, remember that you can click on the top double arrows to sort the full array in ascending or descending order for each of data item that we collate. The column having a single arrow defines the current sort order (Confirmed cases – see details below – in descending order when you open the page first): if the simple arrow is going up, the column is sorted in ascending order. If it is going down, the column is sorted in descending order.

Our data items come in 2 forms either in triplets (left-side data columns) or cases per million, i.e. some form of density related to the population (right-side columns):

- The triplets:
  - Today&#39;s value
  - Delta value (named &quot;Changes today&quot;): it shows the increase / decrease of the today&#39;s value compared to yesterday&#39;s
  - A little arrow of same color: if it goes up, it says that the delta value between today&#39;s and yesterday&#39;s is bigger than the delta between yesterday and the day before. If it goes down, it means the last delta value is smaller than its previous computation.
- The densities: Coronaction statistics provide data for territories going from the entire world with 7.7 billion inhabitants to San Marino with 33&#39;938 inhabitants or even Vatican with 618 inhabitants. So, to introduce fairness in some analysis, it is important for the countries being reviewed to take their population into account otherwise the countries with a high population would always look much worse than they effectively are. The densities are the columns named &quot;xxx per million&quot; on the right side of screen.

The triplets may be a bit hard to understand initially. So, let&#39;s take an example: as of May 9th, for the world, we have:

- Confirmed cases: 4&#39;020&#39;917, arrow up, 85&#39;811. The first number defines the number of cases confirmed since the beginning of the pandemic. The second number means that 85&#39;811 new cases were confirmed between May 8th and May 9th. The arrow up means then that the number between May 7th and May 8th was lower. In summary, the last 24h have brought more cases than the preceding 24h.
- Deceased: 279&#39;205, arrow down, 4&#39;411. The first number defines the number of deaths officially attributed to Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. The second number means that 4&#39;411 new deaths were confirmed between May 8th and May 9th. The arrow down means then that the number between May 7th and May 8th was higher. In summary, the last 24h have brought less deaths than the preceding 24h.

To speak in physical terms: the left number defines the &quot;distance&quot; achieved by the virus outbreak, the second number defines its current speed of progress and the arrow defines the acceleration (is it going faster or slower than it was going just before).

Now, the data items:

- Country name (left-most) and population (right-most) are self-explaining.
- The triplets:
  - Confirmed cases: all the Covid-19 cases that were officially recognized by the medical institutions of a given country.
  - Deceased: deaths resulting from Covid-19 infection that were officially recognized by the medical institutions of a given country.
  - Recovered: previously infected individuals that were officially defined as fully cured from the disease by the medical institutions of a given country.
  - Active: the cases of infection by the corona virus that are considered still not closed (either by death or recovery)
- The densities: it is the values of the triplets above divided by the number of inhabitants for the country being considered.
